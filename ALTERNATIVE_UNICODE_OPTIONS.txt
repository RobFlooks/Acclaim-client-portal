# Alternative Unicode Characters for Hyphen/Minus

# Option 1: Unicode Minus Sign (U+2212) - Mathematical minus, not operator
external_ref = replace(matter.entityref,'-','−')

# Option 2: En Dash (U+2013) - Slightly longer than hyphen
external_ref = replace(matter.entityref,'-','–')

# Option 3: Em Dash (U+2014) - Longer dash
external_ref = replace(matter.entityref,'-','—')

# Option 4: Hyphen-Minus Alternative (U+002D but in different context)
external_ref = replace(matter.entityref,'-','﹣')

# Option 5: Fullwidth Hyphen-Minus (U+FF0D)
external_ref = replace(matter.entityref,'-','－')

# Recommended: Use Unicode Minus (−) as it looks identical to regular hyphen
# but won't be parsed as a mathematical operator by SOS

# Example transformation:
# CLS00003-028 becomes CLS00003−028
# Visually identical but SOS parser treats it as text, not math
