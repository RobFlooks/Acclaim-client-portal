why is this failing?


ChatGPT said:
I’ll need a bit more detail to help—what exactly is failing?

If you can, please share:

The code or command you’re running

The full error message or stack trace

What you expected to happen vs. what actually happened

Once I have that, I can pinpoint the issue and suggest a fix.

ChatGPT said:
It’s failing because your YAML is invalidly indented in the “npm install, build, and test” step — the run: line is not under that step, and the shell lines aren’t indented under run:. In GitHub Actions, each step must be one object in the steps: list; right now you effectively have:

a step with only name: npm install, build, and test

then a stray run: at the wrong indentation level (so the workflow won’t parse)

Here’s the corrected workflow (minimal change, just fixing indentation):

name: Build and deploy Node.js app to Azure Web App - acclaim-api

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20"
          cache: npm

      - name: npm install, build, and test
        run: |
          npm install
          npm run build --if-present
          npm run test --if-present

      - name: Upload artifact for deployment job
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: node-app
          path: |
            .
            !node_modules
            !**/node_modules

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: read

    steps:
      - name: Download artifact from build job
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: node-app

      - name: Login to Azure

          tenant-id: ${{ secrets.AZUREAPPSERVICE_TENANTID_989FF74C3CDF476696EB70EE5FEE08FE }}
          subscription-id: ${{ secrets.AZUREAPPSERVICE_SUBSCRIPTIONID_A8246B9B016941E1876598E2A7C35E55 }}

      - name: Deploy to Azure Web App
        uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v3

          app-name: acclaim-api
          slot-name: Production
          package: .
Two extra “likely next” issues (in case you fix YAML and it still fails):

Artifact contents: Uploading . with exclusions works, but can produce huge artifacts or include unwanted files. Often people upload only dist/ (or .next/, etc.) plus package.json and lockfile.

Azure deploy expectations: azure/webapps-deploy with package: . deploys what you downloaded. If your app needs a build on Azure, make sure App Service build is enabled (Oryx) or upload built output.

If you paste the exact error message from the Actions run, I can tell you which of these (or something else) is the next blocker.
